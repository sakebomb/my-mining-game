**Dig Deep to Victory**

**Grab your pickaxe and plunge into the earth's shadowy depths in this thrilling 3D voxel mining adventure!**

Mine procedurally generated underground worlds—up to 50 levels deep—teeming with tiered ores from humble stone to glittering diamonds. But riches come with risks: battle hordes of melee monsters like zombies, skeletons, and mummies that drop brains, bones, and cloth for crafting powerful helpers and enhancing your gear.

**Core Loop:**
- **Dig & Mine**: Tap-hold to shatter 0.5m blocks, revealing embedded ore veins. Upgrade pickaxes (8 rainbow-glowing tiers: crimson to cosmic white) to access rarer loot.
- **Fight & Loot**: Close-quarters combat—slash through enemies scaling in ferocity with depth. Glowing elites double your drops!
- **Trade & Upgrade**: Surface NPCs buy your haul for cash to snag better backpacks, weapons, armor, and ladders/teleports. Enhance items up to 5x with drops for godlike power.
- **Survive Deeper**: Craft 10-minute helpers (extend with cloth), place ladders, or zip via teleports. Local saves keep your progress safe across sessions.

**Key Features:**
- **Fine Graphics**: PBR shaders, dynamic shadows, particles, bloom glows, and bumpy chiptune audio for immersive vibes.
- **Endless Progression**: Config-driven items/enemies—tweak on the fly. Win by affording the ultimate Victory Scepter (costs a fortune + 10 diamonds) for a triumphant "You Win!" explosion of confetti!
- **Cross-Platform**: Free PWA—smooth PC mouse/keyboard or tablet touch controls (joystick, swipe-look, tap-mine). 60FPS optimized.

Perfect for fans of Minecraft digging, Deep Rock Galactic grit, and SteamWorld Dig progression. **Start free in your browser—no downloads needed. How deep will you go?**
